    description: 'In a future where humanity has colonized the stars, a renegade historian discovers a temporal anomaly that threatens to unravel reality itself.',
    notes: `## Ideas & Scratchpad

- What if the "Helios Incident" wasn't sabotage but a natural temporal paradox Kaelen stumbled upon? Could make his obsession more tragic.
- Rostova's backstory: Maybe the civilian casualties were on a colony world where her own family lived. This would give her a much stronger personal motivation to question the Concordance.
- Possible names for the alien race that created the weapon: The Chronovores? The Weavers? The Architects?
- The anomaly shouldn't just be a "hole in time." It should actively rewrite events, causing confusion and memory lapses for the characters. Imagine Kaelen and Rostova remembering different versions of the same event.

- The first victim had a small, silver serpent pin on his lapel, but it was from a well-known jeweler, not the cult. (Red Herring)
- All victims visited the same rare book shop in the week before their death. The shopkeeper is nervous and evasive. (Clue)
- A strange, sweet-smelling incense is found at every crime scene. What is it? -> Leads to a specific black market apothecary.
- Rumors of a 'Whispering Man' in the docks area. Is he connected or just city gossip?

### Dialogue Snippets
- Elias to Lyra: "Everyone in this city has a price, Lyra. The trick is knowing the currency. Yours is secrets. His is power. Mine... mine is just getting through the day without another ghost whispering in my ear."
- Captain Isolde to Elias: "I don't approve of your methods, Thorne. But I can't deny your results. Just... try not to burn the city down while you're at it."
